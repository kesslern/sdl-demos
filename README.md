sdl-demos
=========

Various graphics demos written in SDL and C. Hopefully, progressively more complicated fractal programs will be foud here.

Currently, two basic demos exist. A template skeleton exists to show the bare bones required to get SDL running in C with
pixel plotting capabilities. The other project, as the name implies, is a visualizer for the mandelbrot set with a basic
escape time algorithm.

Both are under development, lacking comments, but working. Projects under development may be configured for the dvorak
keyboard layout...
